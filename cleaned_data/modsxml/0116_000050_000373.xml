   <abstract>This is the second in a series of publications published by the Education and Human Services Consortium, a loose-knit coalition of national organizations concerned with the interagency efforts to connect children and families with comprehensive services. The first publication,New Partnerships: Education's Stake in the Family Support Act of 1988, was aimed at state and local education and human services policy makers, administrators, and practitioners and explored the potential for collaboration among education and welkfare agencies in the implementation of the new law. This monoigraph looks at why local schools, health and welfare agencies, youth services agencies, community-based organizations, and others must join forces on behalf of children and families, and offers guidance based on emerging experience about how they can move forward together. A third publication in this series isThinking Collaboratively: Questiona and Answers to Help Policy Makers Improve Services for Children,published in 1991.</abstract>
