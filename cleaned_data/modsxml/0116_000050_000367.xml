   <abstract>This briefing book is designed for all those in public life, child advocates, community activists, professionals, policy makers, parents, citizens, members of the media, and political leaders of all parties seeking office in 1988 and their staffs. Its purpose is to ensure basic social literacy among the media, citizens, and candidates for public office about the facts and needed remedies for American children and families and about the high economic and social costs of child neglect to every American. Part 1 lays out key facts in important areas affecting children and families, the gap in current successful programs for children and families, and the cost-effectiveness of preventive investment. Part 2 includes key charts on the status of families and children with state-by-state date. Part 3 shows how America compares to other nations in protecting its children. The appendix outlines the history of important federal investments in children and youths and summarizes the polls that indicate that helping children in 1988 is not only a moral and practical imperative but is also good politics.</abstract>
